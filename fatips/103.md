| 103   | FAT Entry Signing Standard |   .      | Core     | Adam S Levy \<adam@canonical-ledgers.com\> | 1-4-2019 |



# Summary

This standard defines how FAT entries should be signed with a given set of
ed25519 keys so as to completely avoid replay attacks both within and across
chains.

Specifically this standard currently mitigates these known replay attack
vectors:
- Replay across chains.
- Delayed transmission replays. i.e. A signed transaction is held back and
  submitted at a later date.
- External ID reordering.
- Additional External IDs.

# Motivation

As all FAT token standards rely on the uniqueness of the entry hash as a
validity rule, replay attacks can occur when the entry hash can be altered
without invalidating the entry itself. All FAT token standards can adopt this
standard for their signing requirements to avoid replay attacks.


# Specification

## External ID Structure

The External IDs of an entry contain a timestamp salt and the RCD/Signature
pairs required to validate the entry.

| Index | Encoding | Example | Details  |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0       | Decimal String | "1546443301" or `0x31 35 34 36 34 34 33 33 30 31` | A Unix second timestamp that MUST be within +/-12 hours of the entry's on-chain timestamp. By adjusting the timestamp into the future or past, a user can control how long before a signed transaction will expire. |
| 1       | Raw Bytes | `0x01 49 bb 7b 5f bc fc fc 04 75 32 2b a1 4c 80 77 7d 29 bd 37 8c 33 8a 7f f7 fe d0 88 38 20 b1 92 10` | RCD 0 |
| 2       | Raw Bytes | `0x5f 06 e4 87 16 98 44 1e d9 3e da 2a e8 25 d2 a7 d1 59 f4 04 c8 d8 1b 9b 88 ab 11 79 fd c8 f8 de e4 db a3 89 75 d5 43 a2 8b 20 13 5d 24 23 f6 1c 70 72 b5 f5 2f 02 98 64 b2 bc 9e 6d ba 7a ee 02` | Signature 0 |
| ...     | ...  | ...  | ... |
| `X*2+1` | Raw Bytes | ... | RCD `X` |
| `X*2+2` | Raw Bytes | ... | Signature `X` |

The Xth RCD contains the public key corresponding to the private key used to
generate the Xth Signature.

The specific number of RCD/Signature pairs MUST be well-defined as a SINGLE
possible value. Otherwise, the External IDs could potentially be manipulated to
create another valid entry.

## RCD/Signature Pairs

Factom and FAT use the hash of a [Redeem Condition
Datastructure](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#redeem-condition-datastructure-rcd)
to form the payload of the human readable [Factoid
address](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses)
or ID Key. The specific addresses that the RCDs must hash to must be
well-defined by the inheriting specification. The signature in the pair must
verify against the public key contained in the RCD.

### RCD Type

The only currently accepted RCD type is Type 1:

Example RCD: `0x01 49 bb 7b 5f bc fc fc 04 75 32 2b a1 4c 80 77 7d 29 bd 37 8c
33 8a 7f f7 fe d0 88 38 20 b1 92 10`

| Description | Size in Bytes | Example |
| - | - | - |
| RCD Type Byte | 1 | `0x01` |
| ed25519 Public Key | 32 | `0x49 bb 7b 5f bc fc fc 04 75 32 2b a1 4c 80 77 7d 29 bd 37 8c 33 8a 7f f7 fe d0 88 38 20 b1 92 10` |

### RCD Hash

The `sha256d` hash is defined as two rounds of `sha256`.

```
sha256d(data) = sha256(sha256(data))
```

The address that corresponds to an RCD is the RCD Hash.

```
ADDRESS = sha256d(RCD)
```


## Salting, Hashing and Signing

### Salting

The following salts are prepended to the entry content in the order they are
listed below. The example data is pulled from a valid FAT-0 entry with hash
[`c303091d385aa0b9a8afce9bc41eb16113e4af685df41bb1ca9f57dff16e3119`](https://explorer.factom.com/chains/b54c4310530dc4dd361101644fa55cb10aec561e7874a7b786ea3b66f2c6fdfb/entries/c303091d385aa0b9a8afce9bc41eb16113e4af685df41bb1ca9f57dff16e3119).

| Data | Encoding | Example | Details  |
| - | - | - | - |
| RCD/Signature Pair ID | Decimal String | "0", "1", "2", ... , "9", "10" | A zero-based index of the RCD/Signature pairs as they appear in the External IDs. This prevents manipulating the entry hash by reordering the RCD/Signature pairs. Note that this is not the same as the index of the individual External IDs themselves, but of the RCD/Signature pairs, which each require two External IDs. |
| Unix Seconds Timestamp (0th External ID) | Decimal String | "1546443301" or `0x31 35 34 36 34 34 33 33 30 31` | This is the timestamp from the 0th External ID.  |
| Chain ID | 32 Raw Bytes | `0xb5 4c 43 10 53 0d c4 dd 36 11 01 64 4f a5 5c b1 0a ec 56 1e 78 74 a7 b7 86 ea 3b 66 f2 c6 fd fb` | The chain ID the entry is submitted on. This prevents cross chain replay attacks. |

### Hash

The data is hashed with SHA-512 before signing to allow for future integration
with memory limited hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S.

```
DATA = sha512( [RCD/Signature Pair ID] | [Unix Seconds Timestamp] | [Chain ID] | [Entry Content] )
```

### Sign

An ed25519 signature must be generated for `DATA` with the private key
corresponding with the public key contained in the RCD that will appear in the
preceding External ID.


## Validation Rules

The inheriting specification must define the **Signing Set**: *the exact set of
unique addresses that are expected to sign the entry.* There may only be one
possible valid set of unique addresses. The set of addresses may be context
dependent and may also depend on the entry content.

All of the following must be true for an entry to be considered valid:

- The External IDs strictly follow the structure defined above in External ID
  Structure.
- The timestamp provided in the 0th External ID is with +/- 12 hours of the
  entry's recorded timestamp on the Factom blockchain.
- There are exactly `2*N+1` External IDs, where `N` is the number of addresses
  in the Signing Set.
- For each address in the signing set, there exists one RCD in the External IDs
  that hashes to that address.
- All RCD/Signature pairs are valid following the salting and hashing scheme
  defined above.
